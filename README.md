### About me

I am a researcher and teacher at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) in the [Theoretical Computer Science division](https://www.kth.se/tcs) and the [STEP research group](https://kth-step.github.io). I do research primarily on topics related to program verification and [proof engineering](https://proofengineering.org).

### Research interests

I am interested in development of [techniques and tools based on proof assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06458) for construction of functionally correct and secure software systems; see my research publications on [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palmskog:Karl) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=myVdnacAAAAJ). I use [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) for both proving and programming and am a member of the [Coq Team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html), where I help maintain the [Coq opam archive](https://github.com/coq/opam) and [Coq-community](https://github.com/coq-community). I also use [HOL4](https://hol-theorem-prover.org) and program in several dialects in the extended [ML family](http://sml-family.org) such as [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) and [CakeML](https://cakeml.org).
