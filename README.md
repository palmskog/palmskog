## About me

 I am a researcher at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://www.kth.se) in the [Theoretical Computer Science division](https://www.kth.se/tcs), primarily working on topics related to program verification and [proof engineering](https://proofengineering.org].

## Research interests

I am interested in development of techniques and tools based on proof assistants for construction of functionally correct and secure software systems.

I am an avid user of the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr) for both proving and programming, usually complemented by a measure of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org). I also use [HOL4](https://hol-theorem-prover.org) and other dialects in the [ML family](http://sml-family.org).

## Publications

See my research publications on [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Palmskog:Karl) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=myVdnacAAAAJ).
